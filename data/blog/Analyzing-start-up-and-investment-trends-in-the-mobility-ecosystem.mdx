The mobility sector has experienced significant transformation since 2021, with shifting investment patterns, evolving technology priorities, and changing regulatory landscapes reshaping the startup ecosystem. This report examines recent trends in funding, regional dynamics, segment-specific investments, investor profiles, and policy impacts through early 2025, providing a comprehensive analysis of where capital is flowing in the mobility revolution.

## Global Funding Landscape and Regional Dynamics

The global funding environment for mobility startups has undergone dramatic changes since the post-pandemic investment peak of 2021. Total funding rounds declined 25% to approximately 750 in 2023 (from over 1,000 in 2022), including 61 mega-rounds exceeding \$100 million—down from 80 in 2022—highlighting a sharp market contraction. Despite this contraction in deal volume, mobility startup funding stabilized at \$39 billion in 2023 (versus \$40 billion in 2022 and a record \$83 billion in 2021), with average round size increasing 33% to \$52 million, driven by approximately 60 mega-rounds.

### Regional Investment Distribution

The geographic distribution of mobility investments has shifted significantly in recent years. North America—buoyed by the US Inflation Reduction Act—captured approximately 50% of global funding in 2023, with an average round size of \$79.6 million, well above the global average. This dominance is largely driven by mega-rounds in the electric vehicle, battery, and charging infrastructure segments.

Europe presents a more nuanced picture. While its share of global mobility venture capital funding rose from 22% in 2022 to 28% in 2023—[matching U.S. levels for the first time [1]](https://dealroom.co/uploaded/2024/01/European-Mobility-report-2023_-Dealroom_Via-ID.pdf)—European VC investment in mobility startups dropped 26% year-over-year to \$9 billion in 2023. Europe captured 39% of all early-stage (pre-seed and seed) rounds globally, highlighting the region's resilience in nurturing early-stage innovation despite overall funding contraction. However, Europe's average round size was just \$27.5 million, significantly lower than North America's.

Asia's mobility investment landscape has experienced substantial changes, with its share of global funding decreasing from approximately 23% in 2022 to 17% in 2023. This shift is particularly pronounced in the micromobility segment, where Asia's dominance has diminished significantly. Pre-pandemic, Asia captured 60% of global micromobility investments, but this share plunged to just 10% post-COVID (2020-2022), while Europe's share surged from 12% to approximately 50% during the same period.

## Segment-Level Investment Trends

Investment trends across mobility technology segments reveal clear winners and losers, with electric vehicles and related infrastructure capturing increasing attention while other segments have experienced significant pullbacks.

### Electric Vehicles and Supporting Infrastructure

Infrastructure-intensive EV battery and charging segments have emerged as the dominant focus for investors, capturing more than 50% of Europe's \$9 billion mobility venture capital in 2023. EV battery funding alone grew 25% compared to 2022, driven by mega-rounds from companies like Northvolt and Verkor. This reflects a broader battery technology boom, with US startups raising \$9.8 billion versus China's \$5.3 billion between 2021-2023.

<HTMLRenderer htmlFile="html_2.html" />

An aggregated sample of 65 private EV-charging startups funded in 2023-2024 has secured over \$4.9 billion in venture and grant equity to date, with the top 10 alone accounting for approximately \$2.52 billion, led by Electra (\$517.5M), Electrify America (\$450M), and FreeWire Technologies (\$259.3M). In the charging infrastructure segment, total investment increased by approximately 40% between 2022 and 2023, reflecting growing recognition of the critical role charging networks play in EV adoption.

Drilling down further, the early-stage charging infrastructure ecosystem reveals a vibrant cohort of specialized players. Seed and Series A investors have backed 13 niche EV-charging ventures in 2023-2024 for a combined approximately \$263 million—led by Italy/Spain's Powy (\$90.81M), Norway's Wattif EV AS (\$57.97M), and Canada's ChargeLab (\$30.4M).

### Segment Contractions

In contrast to the growing battery and charging segments, several mobility technology areas experienced significant contractions in 2023:

1. **Connected & Self-Driving (Autonomous) Vehicles**: Funding declined 23% in 2023 to \$7.0 billion (from \$9.2 billion in 2022), driven primarily by a pullback in US investment. Interestingly, Europe bucked this trend with 33% growth to \$1.6 billion, suggesting regional differences in autonomous vehicle investment priorities.

2. **Mobility SaaS Solutions**: This segment experienced the most dramatic decline, plunging 52% to \$4.0 billion in 2023. The Americas saw a 55% drop to \$2.8 billion and Asia/Australia a 77% collapse to \$0.3 billion, while Europe again showed resilience with a 9% rise to \$0.8 billion.

3. **Micromobility**: While still attracting significant capital, micromobility investment has shifted geographically and thematically. Of the \$8.4 billion invested across Asia, Europe, and North America from 2020-2022, e-kickscooters dominated with \$5.2 billion (approximately 90% of total). An emerging bright spot within this segment was infrastructure services (parking/charging), which tripled from \$100 million to \$350 million, underscoring operator focus on reducing idle time and operational expenses.

### Emerging Sub-Segments

Within the broader segments, several specialized sub-segments are showing promising growth:

1. **Battery Manufacturing & Recycling**: In 2023 alone, funding by sub-segment exceeded \$8 billion for battery manufacturing (solid-state, Li-S, Na-ion), \$1.3 billion for swapping services, and \$3.8 billion for reuse/recycling. This growth is supported by projections that 100 million EV batteries will retire over the next decade, and recycled materials could supply 40% of new EV battery content by 2040.

2. **Electric Two- and Three-Wheelers**: Early-stage rounds (seed & Series A) in the EV sector fell 20% year-on-year to \$1.4 billion in 2023, but two- and three-wheeler startups raised \$200 million—up from less than \$100 million in prior years. Notably, India accounted for 70% of venture capital in electric two/three-wheelers globally, with its startups raising \$2.7 billion cumulatively between 2018-2023.

## Investor Archetypes: VC vs. CVC Strategies

The mobility investment landscape exhibits a striking bifurcation between venture capital and corporate venture capital approaches, with each pursuing distinct strategies in terms of deal volume, ticket size, and strategic focus.

### Venture Capital: High Volume, Early-Stage Focus

Traditional venture capital firms have dominated deal volume, particularly in early-stage investments. In Q1 2025, specialized VCs massively outpaced corporates in deal frequency: UK's SFC Capital led all Europe-wide backers with 62 rounds totaling £13.4 million (average €2 million per deal) across B2B SaaS and related technologies.

<HTMLRenderer htmlFile="html_3.html" />

The early-stage focus is particularly evident in more technical or specialized mobility segments. By year-end 2024, the top 10 VCs averaged between €775,000 (Genesis Ventures, deeptech) and €35 million (HV Capital, climate tech) per deal, with most falling in the sub-€5 million range. This high-volume approach allows VCs to spread risk across numerous early-stage companies while maintaining the potential for significant returns from breakout successes.

### Corporate Venture Capital: Strategic Mega-Rounds

In stark contrast to the high-volume, smaller-ticket approach of traditional VCs, corporate venture capital (CVC) investors have focused on fewer, larger strategic investments. By 2024, Europe saw over 450 publicly announced CVC equity deals, led by corporate giants pursuing strategic objectives:

- **BNP Paribas** (France): 31 deals averaging €23 million each, predominantly in climate tech (including quantum computing play C12, Lactips, and AI lab Mistral)
- **Novo Holdings** (Denmark): 29 deals averaging €55 million each, focused on healthtech (Orbis Medicines, Circtec, Adcendo)
- **Crédit Agricole** (France): 14 deeptech investments (CibleR, Blackleaf, QiOVA)

Deal-size dispersion between VCs and CVCs is stark: CVC titans like BlackRock (€63 million average, fintech), GV (€56 million, B2B SaaS), and Novo Holdings (€55 million, healthtech) dominated mega-rounds, whereas none of these CVCs breached the top 10 list of most active investors by deal volume—highlighting the bifurcated market of high-volume, sub-€5 million rounds versus fewer, €20+ million strategic bets.

## Policy Catalysts and Macroeconomic Impacts

Government policies, particularly the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal, have emerged as powerful catalysts reshaping investment flows in the mobility ecosystem, with distinct approaches to incentivizing green transition.

### Contrasting Policy Approaches: Tax Credits vs. Grants

The US Inflation Reduction Act devotes \$369 billion to energy and climate incentives, with \$270 billion structured as corporate tax credits, including transferable 45X credits for cell and module production and Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credits. In contrast, the EU Green Deal relies on non-tax incentives—EU and national grants, loans, and the NextGen Fund—to achieve net-zero by 2050, fund low-carbon manufacturing, and support Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI).

<HTMLRenderer htmlFile="html_4.html" />

### Impact on EV Cost Parity and Investment Flows

These policy differences have material impacts on EV adoption timelines and investment decisions. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), battery pack costs are projected to drop from \$122/kWh in 2023 to \$67/kWh by 2032 under mid-price scenarios. Without incentives, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are expected to reach price parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in 2028-29. However, with combined IRA incentives (approximately \$4,500 per vehicle), this parity timeline accelerates by approximately three years to 2025 for 300-mile SUVs.

The IRA's leasing loophole, which allows foreign EVs to qualify for the \$7,500 credit, drove the EV lease share from 15% in December 2022 to 30% in December 2023, demonstrating how policy details can rapidly shift market dynamics. However, this reduced the net social benefits to \$1.02 per subsidy dollar (versus \$1.87 under pre-IRA rules), with the government's cost per incremental EV purchase estimated at \$23,000-32,000.

### Macroeconomic Impacts of Policy Interventions

Economic modeling using the Joint Research Centre's CORTAX model shows that a unilateral IRA would lift US green-sector investment by 21.5% (output +6.5%, wages +8.1%) but depress EU green investment by 2.5% (output -0.5%, wages -1.1%). However, full absorption of EU's €2 trillion Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and NextGenerationEU climate funds would reverse this trend—boosting EU green-sector output by 12%, employment by 5.2%, and wages by 8%—thereby neutralizing the IRA's relocation effects.

Total IRA outlays of \$390-900 billion (2023-31) are on par with all EU green-transition subsidies. Interestingly, a multi-sector, multi-country model projects virtually zero macroeconomic impact on Europe from the IRA: real national-income effects are 0.000% in Germany, –0.004% in France, and –0.001% for the EU as a whole.

## Valuation Recovery and Deal-Size Dynamics

The final dimension of our analysis examines how valuation trends and deal-size dynamics have evolved in the mobility startup ecosystem, providing critical insights into investor sentiment and market health.

### Valuation Recovery Trends

Late-stage tech valuations have rebounded sharply in the first half of 2024, hitting full-year expectations by recovering to approximately 100% of their Q4 2021 peak. This recovery has been driven by three key factors:

1. Top companies avoiding priced rounds until market conditions improved
2. AI companies commanding a median +68% valuation premium over non-AI peers
3. Strong public markets (S&P 500 +19% year-over-year)

<HTMLRenderer htmlFile="html_5.html" />

In the Series A funding stage, signs of improvement are emerging despite ongoing challenges. Median valuations rose approximately 17% year-over-year, and deal sizes increased by about 20% in 2024, indicating stronger company quality. However, a "Series A crunch" persists as seed-stage companies face difficulty securing follow-on funding, creating a bottleneck in the funding pipeline.

### Mega-Deal Dynamics and AI Impact

Mega-deal activity (rounds exceeding \$100 million) has materially slowed from the 2021 peak, with the first half of 2024 on track for fewer mega-rounds yet a more "normalized" pace compared to historical averages. AI-focused rounds have driven 48% of 2024 mega-deal capital (28% of deals), versus a historical approximately 9% share captured by the top 10 deals in any given period.

The impact on mobility is multifaceted. While overall mega-deals have declined, selective investments in strategic areas continue, particularly in capital-intensive segments like battery manufacturing and charging infrastructure. This suggests investors are becoming more discerning rather than withdrawing entirely from large commitments.

### Segment-Specific Deal Patterns

Deal-size and valuation trends vary significantly across mobility segments:

1. **Battery Manufacturing**: Growth-stage funding (Series B and growth equity) in EV and battery startups plunged 35% to \$10.1 billion in 2023, yet the segment remains attractive for mega-rounds, with companies like ONE securing a \$300 million Series B in early 2023.

2. **EV Charging**: This segment shows a bifurcated pattern. While privately funded startups continue to attract significant capital, publicly traded charging networks that went public via SPACs or IPOs between 2020 and mid-2022 (such as EVGo, ChargePoint, and Wallbox) are trading at a small fraction of their peak values. This underscores persistent investor skepticism about current business models despite long-term EV adoption growth.

3. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Facing extended commercialization timelines and regulatory challenges, this segment has seen targeted strategic investments rather than widespread funding. Skydio's \$230 million Series E in February 2023 represents one of the few mega-rounds in this space.

* * *

The mobility investment landscape has undergone significant transformation since 2021, with changes in funding volumes, valuation dynamics, segment priorities, and geographic distribution. While overall funding has contracted from peak levels, average deal sizes have increased, suggesting more focused and strategic capital deployment. Electric vehicle infrastructure—particularly batteries and charging—has emerged as the dominant investment category, buoyed by supportive government policies like the US Inflation Reduction Act and EU Green Deal.

The bifurcation between venture capital and corporate venture approaches highlights distinct strategies: VCs focus on high-volume, early-stage deals under €5 million, while CVCs concentrate on strategic mega-rounds exceeding €50 million. This complementary ecosystem supports innovation across the mobility value chain, from early concept development to large-scale commercialization.

As the market matures, investor focus on sustainable business models, regulatory alignment, and realistic commercialization timelines is becoming increasingly important. The recovery of late-stage valuations to near-peak levels suggests renewed confidence, particularly in companies demonstrating clear paths to profitability or strategic relevance. Looking ahead, the mobility investment landscape is likely to remain selective but supportive of innovations that address critical infrastructure needs, regulatory requirements, and evolving consumer preferences in the transportation revolution.
